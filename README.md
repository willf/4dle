# 4dle

WIP for a Wordle-derivative that selects your first word, and only gives you three more chances.

Cloned from [cwackerfuss/react-wordle](https://github.com/cwackerfuss/react-wordle)

## Build and run

### To Run Locally:

Clone the repository and perform the following command line actions:

```bash
$> cd 4dle
$> npm install
$> npm run start
```

### To build/run docker container:

#### Development

```bash
$> docker build -t reactle:dev -f docker/Dockerfile .
$> docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name reactle-dev reactle:dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in browser.

#### Production

```bash
$> docker build --target=prod -t reactle:prod -f docker/Dockerfile .
$> docker run -d -p 80:8080  --name reactle-prod reactle:prod
```

Open [http://localhost](http://localhost) in browser. See the [entry in the FAQ](#why-does-sharing-of-results-not-work) below about requirements for sharing of results.

### How can I add usage tracking?

This repository includes support for Google Analytics or [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io), but, by default, this is disabled.

To enable Google Analytics:

- Create a Google Analytics 4 property and obtain the measurement ID (of the format `G-XXXXXXXXXX`)
- In [.env](.env), add `REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX`

Keep in mind that your region might have legislation about obtaining a user's consent before enabling trackers. This is up to downstream repos to implement.

To enable Plausible Analytics:

- Create a new website with Plausible Analytics with a given domain, e.g. `example.app`
- In [.env](.env), add `REACT_APP_PLAUSIBLE_DOMAIN=example.app`

### Why does sharing of results not work?

For mobile and wearable devices and smart TVs, sharing of results is initially attempted using the [Web Share API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Share_API). For other devices or when sharing to the Web Share API fails, the results are written to the clipboard. Both these methods will succeed only in a [secure context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts), which require you to implement the HTTPS protocol when hosting this repo on a public domain.
